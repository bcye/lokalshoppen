# BleibLokal

BleibLokal is a not-for-profit project created during the German WirVsVirus Hackathon to help small businesses impacted by
the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

This project allows small businesses to easily accept pick-up orders, without setting up a whole e-commerce site.
Customer are able to create order with only a few clicks without the need to create an account. The can choose a timeslot for pick-up which is predefined by the merchant and limited to a few users by the system to avoid a crowd in front of the store.

The project is currently limited to Germany but can be expanded to other countries as well.
